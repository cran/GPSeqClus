Description: Applies sequential clustering algorithm to animal location data based on user-defined parameters 
    and appends results to the dataframe. Plots interactive cluster maps and provides a summary dataframe
    with attributes for each cluster commonly used as covariates in subsequent modeling efforts. Additional
    functions provide individual keyhole markup language plots for quick assessment, and export 
    global positioning system exchange format files for navigation purposes.
